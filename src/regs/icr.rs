//! 11.6.1 Interrupt Command Register (ICR)
//! The interrupt command register (ICR) is a 64-bit1 local APIC register (see Figure 11-12)
//! that allows software running on the processor to specify and send interprocessor interrupts (IPIs) to other processors in the system.

Destination shorthands are used in place of the 8-bit destination field, and can be sent by software using a single write to the low doubleword of the ICR. Shorthands are defined for the following cases: software self interrupt, IPIs to all processors in the system including the sender, IPIs to all processors in the system excluding the sender.

        ///     The issuing APIC is the one and only destination of the IPI. This destination shorthand allows software to interrupt the processor on which it is executing. An APIC implementation is free to deliver the self-interrupt message internally or to issue the message to the bus and “snoop” it as with any other IPI message.
        /// - 10: (All Including Self)
        ///     The IPI is sent to all processors in the system including the processor sending the IPI. The APIC will broadcast an IPI message with the destination field set to FH for Pentium and P6 family processors and to FFH for Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors.

The APIC broadcasts a message with the physical destination mode and destination field set to FH for Pentium and P6 family processors and to FFH for Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors. Support for this destination shorthand in conjunction with the lowest-priority delivery mode is model specific. For Pentium 4 and Intel Xeon processors, when this shorthand is used together with lowest priority delivery mode, the IPI may be redirected back to the issuing processor.
