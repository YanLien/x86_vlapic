//! 11.4.4 Local APIC Status and Location
//! The status and location of the local APIC are contained in the IA32_APIC_BASE MSR (see Figure 11-5).
//! Figure 11-26. IA32_APIC_BASE MSR Supporting x2APIC
//! Processor support for x2APIC mode can be detected by executing CPUID with EAX=1 and then checking ECX, bit 21 ECX.
//! If CPUID.(EAX=1):ECX.21 is set , the processor supports the x2APIC capability and can be placed into the x2APIC mode.
//! System software can place the local APIC in the x2APIC mode by setting the x2APIC mode enable bit (bit 10) in the IA32_APIC_BASE MSR at MSR address 01BH.
